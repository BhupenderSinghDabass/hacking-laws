**Pull Request Checklist**

Please double check the items below!

- [ ] I have read the [Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/dwmkerr/hacker-laws/blob/master/.github/contributing.md).
- [ ] I have not directly copied text from another location (unless explicitly indicated as a quote) or violated copyright.
- [ ] I have linked to the original Law.
- [ ] I have quote the law (if possible) and the author's name (if possible).
- [ ] I am happy to have my changes merged, so that I appear as a contributor, but also the text altered if required to keep the language consistent in the project.

And don't forget:

- I can handle the table of contents, feel free to leave it out.
- Check to see if other laws should link back to the law you have added.
- Include your **Twitter Handle** if you want me to include you when tweeting this update!
